# Learning-journal-day-07

Today we learned about object literals and constructor functions.
First off, I'm very very very very very thankful to Sam (the instructor) for posting such clean, insightful, useful scaffolds and sample demos for the labs of each day. As a visual learner, I do best when I have been shown the right way to write code so I can work in my punctuation, spacing, and proper code format into memory as well as remembering what commands to use to get what I need done completed in the best format.
Week two has been tougher, I'll admit, but for now, it seems pretty solid so far. However, we still have another 3 days to go, so we'll find out just how bad the infamous week-02 ends up being. Here's hoping it isn't as bad as they say.
