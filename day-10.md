# Learning-journal-day-10

Week two is done, now this weekend is all about catch up in addition to the usual weekend work. Wednesday, I did feel like I got my foot stuck in a pothole and began feeling ...well, stuck. However, I feel much better after having taken more time to myself to read through everything in the code and look up what I needed to do in order to make my functions work. Still working on the bit to generate user input into the table, but I'm making progress and should have it completed by Sunday evening at the latest. I'm still very much confused by actually writing out code, but when looking at existing code, I am better at telling what it's actually doing and in what order. I'm also really glad that I know how to read error messages better now instead of shaking my head at "cannot define property of null."
