# Learning-journal-day-02

  Today we learned to create learning journal entries and use **github** with the command window. We also have **lab-02** to complete today.

  I completed lab-02-day-02 and it was pretty straightforward except getting the  computer to accept all capital user input and capital abbreviations like 'Y' and 'N', but in the end I think I got it solved. I found the whole github process to be pretty easy and managed to upload the lab assignment without incident. Hopefully, this will not jinx me for later setups.
