# Learning-journal-day-18

Today we worked on our stretch goals. Isaiah really worked on the about-us page and the home page styling.
I think that our work flow was mostly in unison by that point. I continued to work on the story with help from Maddy to get through my writer's block. Overall it was a pretty good day, we fixed our merge conflicts (for that day) and we left feeling accomplished.
