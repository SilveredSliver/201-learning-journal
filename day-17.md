# Learning-journal-day-17

Today we finished out minimum viable project. We had a little bit of friction concerning the story, but smoothed things over in the end. We also had to learn to cut down how much we talked to avoid going off onto tangents and not getting our necessary work done. I maybe was a little too adamant about the story and felt a little bashed up about my take on the story, but I realized we don't want to make our project too big and just needed to scale it down some.
