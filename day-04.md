# Learning-journal-day-04

Today we learned about CSS structure, blocks, positioning, etc.
as well as how to write basic javascript functions.
Today was also the first time we had paired projects. I got to work with Isaiah Walker, who I ended up becoming good friends with. It was a pleasure to work with him and we did not encounter any merge conflicts and were able to complete the assignment well before 4:00 pm. Despite having no prior experience, Isaiah ended up teaching me a ffew things about my code and helped me remember the sequence in which one types in git commands to pull and push from the github cloud to my machine.
