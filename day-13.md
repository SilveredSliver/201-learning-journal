Today was a little bit of a wash-out it feels like because I went through 3 TA's to attempt to get local storage working fully on my code and it doesn't seem to have work, all because I have three event listeners instead of just one. I'm a little annoyed at myself for making code that isn't so cut and dry, but at the same time, I was really happy to have written code that actually worked, not to mention rendered a chart. Hopefully I can find a workaround or I'll just have to do what the TAs tell me to do, which is refactor my entire code.
