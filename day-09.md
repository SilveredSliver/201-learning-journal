They weren't kidding, week two is definitely a couple of steps up from week one in terms of what gets thrown at you. However, I think the hardest part was just the event listener and figuring out how to make the footer work. I have th "scaffolding" for it, I just am missing the link between the button submit and the function that takes the input information and renders it. It's probably a placement issue or I'm forgetting to call it somewhere.
